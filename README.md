I love learning and am enjoying the process of re-learning to code. I went to college for computer science 20 years ago but dropped out before completing a degree. While the coding came naturally to me, I enjoyed being active much more. After 2 decades of playing basketball, and becoming a successful nutrition coach and personal trainer, I've re-enrolled in college, this time for Biochemistry. As far as coding, I am currently learning Python in hopes of getting into Machine Learning and AI. It seems cliche to say that now, but I believe AI will disrupt many industries, mine included, so I figured it's better to put myself out of a job than to be standing around with my hands out. I'm very excited to learn more and more. Biochemistry, coding, physics, calculus, neuroscience, nutritional science, exercise physiology...I want to maximize my skillset in all of these areas to earn financial freedom by helping others live healthier, more fulfilled lives.
